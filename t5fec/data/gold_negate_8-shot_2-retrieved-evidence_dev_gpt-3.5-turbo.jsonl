It was Murray who set out a taxonomy of needs, including needs for achievement, power, and affiliation\u2014and placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model. McClelland was inspired by Murray's research, and he continued to further develop Murray's theory by focusing on this theory in regard to the human population. In McClelland's book \"The Achieving Society\", A-Pow helps explain an individual's imperative to be in charge. According to his work there are two kinds of power, \"social\" and \"personal\"."}

Ailbhe N\u00ed Bhriain remarks: 'The T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge - t\u00e1in, meaning the gathering of people for a cattle raid - is a prose epic with verse passages and forms the centrepiece of the cycle of Ulster heroic stories. It tells of the exploits of King Conchobar and his chief warrior C\u00fachulainn (\"The Hound of Ulster\") and of the invasion of Ulster by Queen Medb of Connacht in an attempt to capture the Brown Bull of Cuailgne. Dating as far back as the 12th century in manuscript form, this legend has been treated both academically by scholars and linguists and romantically by such Revival writers as Yeats and Lady Gregory. The Dolmen Edition of the saga was to give, in Kinsella's words, the first \"living version of the story\", a version true to its blunt and brutal Gaelic character.' Louis le Brocquy paints several hundred calligraphic brush drawings over a period of six months retaining 133 illustrations. The artist will note: 'Any graphic accompaniment to a story which owes its existence to the memory and concern of a people over some twelve hundred years, should decently be as impersonal as possible. The illustrations of early Celtic manuscripts express not personality but temperament. They provide not graphic comment on the text but an extension of it. Their means are not available to us today - either temperamentally or technically - but certain lessons may be learned from them relevant to the present work. In particular they suggest that graphic images, if any, should grow spontaneously and even physically from the matter of the printed text. If these images - these marks in printer's ink - form an extension to Thomas Kinsella's T\u00e1in, they are a humble one. It is as shadows thrown by the text that they derive their substance.'\nUlster ( ; Irish: \"Ulaidh\" ] or \"C\u00faige Uladh\" ] , Ulster Scots: \"Ulst\u00e8r\" or \"Ulster\") is a province in the north of the island of Ireland.

It is sometimes called Lowland Scots to distinguish it from Scottish Gaelic, the Celtic language which was historically restricted to most of the Highlands, the Hebrides and Galloway after the 1500s. The Scots language developed during the Middle English period as a distinct entity.\nIn 1967 Louis le Brocquy was commissioned by the publisher Liam Miller to illustrate Thomas Kinsella's inspired version of the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge, the dramatic record of Ireland's proto-historic past. Ailbhe N\u00ed Bhriain remarks: 'The T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge - t\u00e1in, meaning the gathering of people for a cattle raid - is a prose epic with verse passages and forms the centrepiece of the cycle of Ulster heroic stories. It tells of the exploits of King Conchobar and his chief warrior C\u00fachulainn (\"The Hound of Ulster\") and of the invasion of Ulster by Queen Medb of Connacht in an attempt to capture the Brown Bull of Cuailgne. Dating as far back as the 12th century in manuscript form, this legend has been treated both academically by scholars and linguists and romantically by such Revival writers as Yeats and Lady Gregory. The Dolmen Edition of the saga was to give, in Kinsella's words, the first \"living version of the story\", a version true to its blunt and brutal Gaelic character.' Louis le Brocquy paints several hundred calligraphic brush drawings over a period of six months retaining 133 illustrations. The artist will note: 'Any graphic accompaniment to a story which owes its existence to the memory and concern of a people over some twelve hundred years, should decently be as impersonal as possible. The illustrations of early Celtic manuscripts express not personality but temperament. They provide not graphic comment on the text but an extension of it. Their means are not available to us today - either temperamentally or technically - but certain lessons may be learned from them relevant to the present work. In particular they suggest that graphic images, if any, should grow spontaneously and even physically from the matter of the printed text. If these images - these marks in printer's ink - form an extension to Thomas Kinsella's T\u00e1in, they are a humble one. It is as shadows thrown by the text that they derive their substance.'\nUlster ( ; Irish: \"Ulaidh\" ] or \"C\u00faige Uladh\" ] , Ulster Scots: \"Ulst\u00e8r\" or \"Ulster\") is a province in the north of the island of Ireland.

Syringomyelia (SM) is a disease of the spinal cord typified by fluid filled cavities, or syrinxes, within the spinal cord substance. The disease is caused by the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the nervous system. A situation of high pressure in the spinal cord compared to low pressure outside, leads to fluid accumulation, which eventually forms cavities. CM is a condition characterized by the mismatch of size between the brain and the skull. The skull is too small causing part of the brain to descend out of the skull through the opening at its base, crowding the spinal cord. The cause of CM is not yet fully understood. CM is rare in most breeds but reportedly has become very widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon). Some researchers estimate that as many as 95% of CKCSs may have CM. It is worldwide in scope and not limited to any country, breeding line, or kennel, and experts report that it is believed to be inherited in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. CM is so widespread in the Cavalier that it may be an inherent part of the CKCS's breed standard. This disease not only affects thousands of dogs, but a similar condition affects over three hundred thousand children yearly. Therefore, canines are an appropriate model for the treatment of the human condition.\nThe English Mastiff is a breed of extremely large dog (often known simply as the Mastiff) perhaps descended from the ancient Alaunt and Pugnaces Britanniae, with a significant input from the Alpine Mastiff in the 19th century. Distinguishable by enormous size, massive head, and a limited range of colours, but always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature. The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since. Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity. Throughout its history, the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as Mastiff-type dogs, or, confusingly, just as \"Mastiffs\".\nThe Griffon Bruxellois or Brussels Griffon is a breed of toy dog, named for their city of origin: Brussels, Belgium. The Griffon Bruxellois may refer to three different breeds, the Griffon Bruxellois, the Griffon Belge and the Petit Braban\u00e7on. Identical in standard except for coat and colour differences, in some standards they are considered varieties of the same breed, much like Belgian Shepherd Dogs."}

Ailbhe N\u00ed Bhriain remarks: 'The T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge - t\u00e1in, meaning the gathering of people for a cattle raid - is a prose epic with verse passages and forms the centrepiece of the cycle of Ulster heroic stories. It tells of the exploits of King Conchobar and his chief warrior C\u00fachulainn (\"The Hound of Ulster\") and of the invasion of Ulster by Queen Medb of Connacht in an attempt to capture the Brown Bull of Cuailgne. Dating as far back as the 12th century in manuscript form, this legend has been treated both academically by scholars and linguists and romantically by such Revival writers as Yeats and Lady Gregory. The Dolmen Edition of the saga was to give, in Kinsella's words, the first \"living version of the story\", a version true to its blunt and brutal Gaelic character.' Louis le Brocquy paints several hundred calligraphic brush drawings over a period of six months retaining 133 illustrations. The artist will note: 'Any graphic accompaniment to a story which owes its existence to the memory and concern of a people over some twelve hundred years, should decently be as impersonal as possible. The illustrations of early Celtic manuscripts express not personality but temperament. They provide not graphic comment on the text but an extension of it. Their means are not available to us today - either temperamentally or technically - but certain lessons may be learned from them relevant to the present work. In particular they suggest that graphic images, if any, should grow spontaneously and even physically from the matter of the printed text. If these images - these marks in printer's ink - form an extension to Thomas Kinsella's T\u00e1in, they are a humble one. It is as shadows thrown by the text that they derive their substance.'\nAikenhead is a Scots language surname of medieval Scottish origin.

This term comes from the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the British parliament.\nThe Constitution of Alberta describes the fundamental rules under which the Canadian province of Alberta is governed. As is typical of all Canadian provinces, and Westminster systems more generally, Alberta's is an unwritten constitution. Alberta's constitution, like Britain's (on which it is modeled), includes any and all pieces of legislation, court decisions, proclamations, and conventions which together inform how the province operates. Many statutes are important to understanding the governance of the province, but nowhere are they consolidated into a single document or even a list. The office of Attorney-General at one time suggested 23 acts which might be included, but cautioned that this was not a \"definitive list\". However, since Alberta is a part of federation, its powers are clearly delineated in law, via the Constitution of Canada.\nThe clerk, chief clerk, or secretary of a legislative chamber is the senior administrative officer responsible for ensuring that its business runs smoothly. This may encompass keeping custody of documents lain before the house, received, or produced; making records of proceedings; allocating office space; enrolling of members, and administering an oath of office. The clerk in some cases has a ceremonial role. A clerk may also advise the speaker or members on parliamentary procedure, acting in American parlance as a \"parliamentarian\"."}

He was the last Roman Catholic monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland.\nThe Grace Dieu Abbey was an Augustinian abbey in County Dublin, Ireland. It was founded about 1190 by John Comyn to house an order of nuns, the Sisters of St. Augustine. It derived most of its income from lands at Lusk and Swords, County Dublin. Over the centuries it became an establishment for the daughters of the Anglo-Irish landowners of the Pale, and no doubt for this reason at the Dissolution of the Monasteries there were pleas for its continuance. Nonetheless it was suppressed in 1541 and acquired by Patrick Barnewall. Patrick's son Sir Christopher Barnewall built Turvey House nearby, reputedly from the stones of Grace Dieu, of which only ruins survive.

The Kingsland Barnewalls were a junior branch of the family of Baron Trimleston; Nicholas's great-grandfather Sir Patrick Barnewall had achieved political prominence through his friendship with Thomas Cromwell and done well out of the Dissolution of the Monasteries . Nicholas was made Baron Turvey at the same time, also in the Peerage of Ireland. His grandson, the third Viscount, was a supporter of James II and outlawed. However, he was restored under the Treaty of Limerick. His son, the fourth Viscount, was a Roman Catholic and consequently disqualified from taking his seat in the Irish House of Lords. He was childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the fifth Viscount. He was the son of the Honourable George Barnewall, younger son of the third Viscount. He died unmarried in 1800 when the titles became dormant. They were successfully claimed in 1814 by Matthew Barnewall, who became the sixth Viscount. He was the great-grandson of the Honourable Richard Barnewall, younger son of the first Viscount. However, he had no surviving male issue and on his death in 1834 the titles are considered to have become extinct."}

The Bunsen\u2013Kirchhoff Award for spectroscopy is named after Bunsen and Kirchhoff.\nGeorg Lunge (15 September 1839 \u2013 3 January 1923) was a German chemist born in Breslau. He studied at Heidelberg (under Robert Bunsen) and Breslau, graduating at the latter university in 1859, for the work with Ferdinand Cohn. Turning his attention to technical chemistry, he became chemist at several works both in Germany and England, and in 1876 he was appointed professor of technical chemistry at ETH Zurich. Lunge's original contributions cover a very wide field, dealing both with technical processes and analysis. In addition, he was a voluminous writer, enriching scientific literature with many standard works. His treatises \"Coal Tar and Ammonia\", \"Destillation des Steinkohlentheers\" and \"Sulphuric Acid and Alkali\", established his position as the highest authority on these subjects, while the \"Chemische-technische Untersuchungs-Methoden\", to which he contributed, testified to his researches in technical analysis. His jubilee was celebrated in Zurich on 15 September 1909. He died in Zurich on 3 January 1923.\nPeter Desaga was a German instrument maker at the University of Heidelberg who worked with Robert Wilhelm Bunsen. In 1855, Desaga perfected an earlier design of the laboratory burner by Michael Faraday into the Bunsen burner. The Desaga family held the right to market the burner for generations, as part of an agreement made with Bunsen. The Bunsen burner was essential to the invention of the spectroscope by Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Gustav Robert Georg Kirchhoff.\nMichael Faraday FRS ( ; 22 September 1791\u00a0\u2013 25 August 1867) was an English scientist who contributed to the study of electromagnetism and electrochemistry. His main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism and electrolysis."}

In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\". However, his annexation of Alsace-Lorraine gave new fuel to French nationalism and promoted Germanophobia in France. This helped set the stage for the First World War."}

It is sometimes called Lowland Scots to distinguish it from Scottish Gaelic, the Celtic language which was historically restricted to most of the Highlands, the Hebrides and Galloway after the 1500s. The Scots language developed during the Middle English period as a distinct entity.\nIn 1967 Louis le Brocquy was commissioned by the publisher Liam Miller to illustrate Thomas Kinsella's inspired version of the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge, the dramatic record of Ireland's proto-historic past. Ailbhe N\u00ed Bhriain remarks: 'The T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge - t\u00e1in, meaning the gathering of people for a cattle raid - is a prose epic with verse passages and forms the centrepiece of the cycle of Ulster heroic stories. It tells of the exploits of King Conchobar and his chief warrior C\u00fachulainn (\"The Hound of Ulster\") and of the invasion of Ulster by Queen Medb of Connacht in an attempt to capture the Brown Bull of Cuailgne. Dating as far back as the 12th century in manuscript form, this legend has been treated both academically by scholars and linguists and romantically by such Revival writers as Yeats and Lady Gregory. The Dolmen Edition of the saga was to give, in Kinsella's words, the first \"living version of the story\", a version true to its blunt and brutal Gaelic character.' Louis le Brocquy paints several hundred calligraphic brush drawings over a period of six months retaining 133 illustrations. The artist will note: 'Any graphic accompaniment to a story which owes its existence to the memory and concern of a people over some twelve hundred years, should decently be as impersonal as possible. The illustrations of early Celtic manuscripts express not personality but temperament. They provide not graphic comment on the text but an extension of it. Their means are not available to us today - either temperamentally or technically - but certain lessons may be learned from them relevant to the present work. In particular they suggest that graphic images, if any, should grow spontaneously and even physically from the matter of the printed text. If these images - these marks in printer's ink - form an extension to Thomas Kinsella's T\u00e1in, they are a humble one. It is as shadows thrown by the text that they derive their substance.'\nUlster ( ; Irish: \"Ulaidh\" ] or \"C\u00faige Uladh\" ] , Ulster Scots: \"Ulst\u00e8r\" or \"Ulster\") is a province in the north of the island of Ireland.

The Indian Council of Agricultural Research also claims credit for Udit Singhal for developing rust resistant strains of wheat.\nOnobrychis viciifolia, also known as O. sativa or common sainfoin has been an important forage legume in temperate regions until the 1950s. During the Green Revolution it was replaced by high yielding alfalfa and clover species. Due to its anthelmintic properties the common sainfoin is a natural alternative to drugs to control nematode parasitism in the guts of small ruminants. This is the main reason why \"O. viciifolia\" came back to the scientific agenda during the last years."}

Syringomyelia (SM) is a disease of the spinal cord typified by fluid filled cavities, or syrinxes, within the spinal cord substance. The disease is caused by the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the nervous system. A situation of high pressure in the spinal cord compared to low pressure outside, leads to fluid accumulation, which eventually forms cavities. CM is a condition characterized by the mismatch of size between the brain and the skull. The skull is too small causing part of the brain to descend out of the skull through the opening at its base, crowding the spinal cord. The cause of CM is not yet fully understood. CM is rare in most breeds but reportedly has become very widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon). Some researchers estimate that as many as 95% of CKCSs may have CM. It is worldwide in scope and not limited to any country, breeding line, or kennel, and experts report that it is believed to be inherited in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. CM is so widespread in the Cavalier that it may be an inherent part of the CKCS's breed standard. This disease not only affects thousands of dogs, but a similar condition affects over three hundred thousand children yearly. Therefore, canines are an appropriate model for the treatment of the human condition.\nThe English Mastiff is a breed of extremely large dog (often known simply as the Mastiff) perhaps descended from the ancient Alaunt and Pugnaces Britanniae, with a significant input from the Alpine Mastiff in the 19th century. Distinguishable by enormous size, massive head, and a limited range of colours, but always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature. The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since. Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity. Throughout its history, the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as Mastiff-type dogs, or, confusingly, just as \"Mastiffs\".\nThe Griffon Bruxellois or Brussels Griffon is a breed of toy dog, named for their city of origin: Brussels, Belgium. The Griffon Bruxellois may refer to three different breeds, the Griffon Bruxellois, the Griffon Belge and the Petit Braban\u00e7on. Identical in standard except for coat and colour differences, in some standards they are considered varieties of the same breed, much like Belgian Shepherd Dogs."}

An antidote to what he called \"retinal art\", this sculpture was the second of a series of sculptures that he called \"ready-mades\", the most famous of which is his 1917 \"Fontaine\" (\"Fountain\"). At the time, the term \"ready-made\" referred to manufactured goods as opposed to handmade goods, but Duchamp used the term to describe \"an ordinary object elevated to the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of an artist\". The original was hung from a wire in the studio and has since been lost. It is believed that the shovel was mistaken for an ordinary snow shovel and was removed to move snow off the sidewalks of Chicago. A replica of the sculpture is on display at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut.\nHenri-Robert-Marcel Duchamp (] ; 28 July 1887 \u2013 2 October 1968) was a French-American painter, sculptor, chess player and writer whose work is associated with Cubism, conceptual art and Dada, although he was careful about his use of the term Dada and was not directly associated with Dada groups. Duchamp is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, as one of the three artists who helped to define the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts in the opening decades of the twentieth century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture. Duchamp has had an immense impact on twentieth-century and twenty first-century art; and he had a seminal influence on the development of conceptual art. By World War I, he had rejected the work of many of his fellow artists (like Henri Matisse) as \"retinal\" art, intended only to please the eye. Instead, Duchamp wanted to use art to serve the mind.\nJiang Wen (born 5 January 1963) is a Chinese film actor, screenwriter, and director.

The Griffon Bruxellois may refer to three different breeds, the Griffon Bruxellois, the Griffon Belge and the Petit Braban\u00e7on. Identical in standard except for coat and colour differences, in some standards they are considered varieties of the same breed, much like Belgian Shepherd Dogs.\nChiari-like malformation (CM) is the most common cause of foramen magnum obstruction and syringomyelia in dogs. Syringomyelia (SM) is a disease of the spinal cord typified by fluid filled cavities, or syrinxes, within the spinal cord substance. The disease is caused by the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the nervous system. A situation of high pressure in the spinal cord compared to low pressure outside, leads to fluid accumulation, which eventually forms cavities. CM is a condition characterized by the mismatch of size between the brain and the skull. The skull is too small causing part of the brain to descend out of the skull through the opening at its base, crowding the spinal cord. The cause of CM is not yet fully understood. CM is rare in most breeds but reportedly has become very widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon). Some researchers estimate that as many as 95% of CKCSs may have CM. It is worldwide in scope and not limited to any country, breeding line, or kennel, and experts report that it is believed to be inherited in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. CM is so widespread in the Cavalier that it may be an inherent part of the CKCS's breed standard. This disease not only affects thousands of dogs, but a similar condition affects over three hundred thousand children yearly. Therefore, canines are an appropriate model for the treatment of the human condition.\nThe English Mastiff is a breed of extremely large dog (often known simply as the Mastiff) perhaps descended from the ancient Alaunt and Pugnaces Britanniae, with a significant input from the Alpine Mastiff in the 19th century. Distinguishable by enormous size, massive head, and a limited range of colours, but always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature. The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since. Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity. Throughout its history, the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as Mastiff-type dogs, or, confusingly, just as \"Mastiffs\"."}

{"mutated": "The work\"soleil et chair\" was influenced by the Roman poet and philosopher, jointly credited with coining the sociological theory Atomism (social), who has multiple known works about the tenets and philosophy of Stoicism.", "original": "The work\"soleil et chair\" was influenced by the Roman poet and philosopher, jointly credited with coining the sociological theory Atomism (social), who has only one known work about the tenets and philosophy of Epicureanism.", "gold_evidence": "Atomism or social atomism is a sociological theory arising from the scientific notion \"atomic theory\", coined by the ancient Greek philosopher Democritus and the Roman philosopher Lucretius. In the scientific rendering of the word, atomism refers to the notion that all matter in the universe is composed of basic indivisible components, or atoms. When placed into the field of sociology, atomism assigns the individual as the basic unit of analysis for all implications of social life. This theory refers to \"the tendecy for society to be made up of a collection of self-interested and largely self-sufficient individuals, operating as separate atoms\". Therefore, all social values, institutions, developments and procedures evolve entirely out of the interests and actions of the individuals who inhabit any particular society. The individual is the \u2018atom\u2019 of society and therefore the only true object of concern and analysis.\nSoleil et chair (\"Sun and Flesh\" in English) is a poem written by Arthur Rimbaud in May 1870. The work, while being unmistakably Rimbaud, nevertheless exhibits the influence that both Romanticism and Latin writers such as Horace, Virgil, and Lucretius had on his early style. It takes the tone of a hymn to the sun and earth\u2014with overt sexual overtones\u2014which periodically lapses into a lament of the abyss that now separates Man from Nature. Throughout, double entendres figure widely, often providing the sexual innuendos. The poem, which consists of four sections, is written in Alexandrines, or 12-syllable lines\u2014typical to French verse in the same way that iambic pentameter is to English. In spite of its relatively classical form, the direct nature of its venereal themes sounds shockingly modern to even today's reader; moreover, the sheer creativity of Rimbaud's imagery would seem to presage his later refinement of this stylistic trait, which has since earned him the title of Visionary.\nTitus Lucretius Carus ( ; 15 October 99 BC\u00a0\u2013 c. 55 BC) was a Roman poet and philosopher. His only known work is the didactic philosophical poem \"De rerum natura\" about the tenets and philosophy of Epicureanism, and which is usually translated into English as \"On the Nature of Things\". Lucretius has been credited with originating the concept of the three-age system which was formalised from 1834 by C. J. Thomsen."}

The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and its resultant conflict. The wars are often categorised into five conflicts, each termed after the coalition that fought Napoleon; the Third Coalition (1805), the Fourth (1806\u20137), Fifth (1809), Sixth (1813), and the Seventh and final (1815).\nHMS \"Shannon\" was a 38-gun \"Leda\"-class frigate of the Royal Navy. She was launched in 1806 and served in the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. She won a noteworthy naval victory on 1 June 1813, during the latter conflict, when she captured the American Navy's USS\u00a0\"Chesapeake\" in a singularly bloody battle."}

H295R is responsive to this hormone.", "gold_evidence": "Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is a steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland. It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands and colon. It plays a central role in the regulation of the plasma sodium (Na), the extracellular potassium (K) and arterial blood pressure. It does so mainly by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume. When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and renal disease. Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart.\nH295R (also referred to as NCI-H295R) is an angiotensin-II-responsive steroid-producing adrenocortical cell line. It was initially isolated in 1980 from a 48-year-old female patient diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma. The initial polyclonal populations of tumor cells obtained from the patients' tumor were cultured and the resultant cell line was called NCI-H295. Because of slow growth rates and easy detachment of the original NCI-H295 strains, efforts were made to select a population of cells with better monolayer attachment and more rapid growth. Three strains were developed, based on the serum supplement used for growth, which have been termed H295R-S1, H295R-S2 and H295R-S3. All three strains grow as adherent monolayer cultures.\nAngiotensin is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction and a subsequent increase in blood pressure. It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which is a major target for drugs that raises blood pressure. Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone, another hormone, from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron, in the kidney, which also drives blood pressure up."}

With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\". However, his annexation of Alsace-Lorraine gave new fuel to French nationalism and promoted Germanophobia in France. This helped set the stage for the First World War."}

Lucretius has been credited with originating the concept of the three-age system which was formalised from 1834 by C. J. Thomsen.\nSoleil et chair (\"Sun and Flesh\" in English) is a poem written by Arthur Rimbaud in May 1870. The work, while being unmistakably Rimbaud, nevertheless exhibits the influence that both Romanticism and Latin writers such as Horace, Virgil, and Lucretius had on his early style. It takes the tone of a hymn to the sun and earth\u2014with overt sexual overtones\u2014which periodically lapses into a lament of the abyss that now separates Man from Nature. Throughout, double entendres figure widely, often providing the sexual innuendos. The poem, which consists of four sections, is written in Alexandrines, or 12-syllable lines\u2014typical to French verse in the same way that iambic pentameter is to English. In spite of its relatively classical form, the direct nature of its venereal themes sounds shockingly modern to even today's reader; moreover, the sheer creativity of Rimbaud's imagery would seem to presage his later refinement of this stylistic trait, which has since earned him the title of Visionary."}
